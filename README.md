FM-js_JSON
===========
This file uses javascript to parse JSON. Since JSON was built specifically to be used by javascript, it makes sense to utilize the javascript engine via the Web Viewer in Filemaker Pro and FileMaker Go.

It can be easily adapted to your solutions as needed. There are minimal fields involved, and a couple scripts that drive the solution. 

To run the demo:

1. Modify the object you want to reference in the field provided. Note that arrays start at zero (0).

2. Click the "Get Object" button

3. View the results. 

The javascript used is in the Resources table, and can be modified for your use from there.
